# My-Notes-Project

My Notes Project is My First Web Project and it's like a Notes Saver

I use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, BootStrap & Web API (LocalStorage & SessionStorage) to Build this Project

Also, I use Responsive Design So, this Project is compatible with Mobile Phones, Tablets, Ipads & Laptops
